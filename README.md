# Flutter in Action project repos

This repo houses the projects needed to follow along with the (forthcoming) Flutter in Action book with Manning Publishing.

- Chapter 1 - no projects
- Chapter 2 - `helloworld`
- Chapter 3 - `dart_pos` is the repo needed to *start* the chapter.
- Chapter 4 - The `counter_app` repo is the *final* state of the project in the chapter. You don't need a repo to start, as you'll use the default app created with `flutter create`.
- Chapter 5 - ? - `weather_app_start` is the repo that begins the chapter. `weather_app` is the final code.
